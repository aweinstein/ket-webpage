	abstract = {A thermodynamic analysis of the synthesis of face-centred cubic (fcc) and body-centred cubic (bcc) solid solutions of Ti-based alloys produced by mechanical alloying was performed. Four Ti-based alloys were analysed: (i) Ti-13Ta-3Sn (at.\%), (ii) Ti-30Nb-13Ta (at.\%), (iii) Ti-20Nb-30Ta (wt. \%) and (iv) Ti-33Nb-4Mn (at.\%). The milled powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction, and the crystallite size and microstrain were determined using the Rietveld and Williamson\&ndash;Hall methods. The Gibbs free energy of mixing for the formation of a solid solution of the three ternary systems (Ti-Ta-Sn, Ti-Nb-Ta and Ti-Nb-Mn) was calculated using an extended Miedema\&rsquo;s model, applying the Materials Analysis Applying Thermodynamics (MAAT) software. The values of the activity of each component were determined by MAAT. It was found that increasing the density of crystalline defects, such as dislocations and crystallite boundaries, changed the solubility limit in these ternary systems. Therefore, at longer milling times, the Gibbs free energy increases, so there is a driving force to form solid solutions from elemental powders. Finally, there is agreement between experimental and thermodynamic data confirming the formation of solid solutions.},

	abstract = {The Ti-Pt phase diagram was revised in light of new findings in the research related to the fabrication of alloys for high temperature shape memory alloy (HTSMA) application. This study focuses on alloys in the composition range 30–40at.\% Pt. Unfortunately, the Ti-Pt phase diagram is poorly understood in this composition range making the development of HTSMAs difficult. Consequently, alloys in this range were cast, heat treated, and characterized using differential thermal analysis (DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It will be shown that the peritectoid (Ti3Pt+β −TiPt →Ti4Pt3) proposed by Biggs and coworkers exists, but because of sluggish transformation kinetic, the high temperature DTA peaks are due to the transformation of β-TiPt to Ti4Pt3 and vice-versa; this sometimes produces a lamellar morphology when the alloys are cooled slowly from temperatures above 1240°C. In addition, the alloys frequently contained more than two phases even after equilibration treatments. One of these phases is a new phase of approximate composition Ti5Pt3, which is believed to be stabilized by oxygen.},

In this work, we studied the synthesis and characterization of Ti-13Zr-13Ta-3Nb (wt.\%) alloy foams which present high potential for biomedical applications. A Ti-Nb-Ta-Zr mixture was produced by mechanical alloying using a planetary mill. Ti alloy foams were obtained using NaCl as a space-holder (40, 50, and 60 v/v \%) that was mixed with the metallic powders and compacted under 420 MPa stress. NaCl particles were removed from the green compacts by submerging samples in distilled water at 60 °C. The green compacts were sintered at 1300 °C for 3 h in Ar atmosphere. Powders and foams were characterized by SEM and optical microscopy. The results showed that Ti-based foams with a tailored heterogeneous pore distribution can be obtained using the space holder method. The elastic modulus (E) of foams was estimated and measured between 5 and 25 GPa using theoretical and finite element analysis (FEA) models which are close to the E values measured experimentally. The results showed that foams with 50\% and 60\% porosity are potential bone replacement materials because their E value is closer to the E value of human bone.},

	abstract = {Froth plays an important role in flotation processes preventing the pulp transport to the concentrate (short-circuit). Thus, it contributes to increasing the concentrate grade by gravity drainage of entrained particles, back into the pulp. Key parameters affecting the froth performance are the mean residence times of solids, liquid and gas in the froth. The froth mean residence time depends on the froth depth, gas flowrate, gas hold-up, and flow regime. In this work, the froth mean residence times were evaluated from direct measurements of liquid and solid time responses in the froth of self-aerated copper flotation cells of 130m3. For this purpose the radioactive tracer technique was applied, using 82Br as liquid tracer, and non-floatable mineral particles in three size classes (+150; −150+45;−45μm) as solid tracers. All tracers were injected at the cell feed entrance, which allowed the tracer to circulate first through the rotor, and become well distributed over the whole cross-sectional area before entering the froth. Each tracer time response was measured on-line below the pulp/froth interface (input signal) and at the concentrate overflow discharge (output signal). The froth mean residence time was then obtained by difference between the average times of the froth input and output tracer signals, previously modelled. For the copper rougher flotation, the froth mean residence time (9–12s) of non-floatable solids, derived from experimental measurement, was comparable with that obtained by measuring the gas flowrate and estimating the effective gas volume in the froth. While, the froth mean residence times of liquid and floatable solid were significantly larger, 21 and 24s, respectively.},

It was found that a single large industrial cell with a volume of 130 to 250 m3, now used in plant operations, can be well represented by an LTST (large and small tank-in-series) model plus dead time. From a scale-up point of view, results showed a similar mixing behavior for industrial cells ranging from 130 to 250 m3. Also, single mechanical cells showed a similar mixing pattern (RTD) when compared to large pneumatic flotation columns. It was confirmed that for practical purposes, the mixing condition in a flotation bank of three or more cells in series can be well described by the classical N tanks-in-series model.},

The approach is analogous to the boundary layer analysis in fluid mechanics, and is based on the methodology of scaling. The results are a set of novel closed-form expressions for the maximum temperature reached in the process, the thickness of the shear layer, the shear stress around the pin, the torque and the thermal effect of the shoulder. The model presented focuses on the most common conditions encountered in the practice of FSW, which involve relatively slow translation velocities, relatively high rotation velocities and thin shear layers. The ultimate purpose of this model is to provide simple and accurate expressions useful for providing a temperature and strain rate context for metallurgical analysis of FSW and for the selection of process parameters when using FSW to join novel alloys.},

The alloys were synthesized by mechanical alloying using a planetary mill, jar and balls of stabilized yttrium. Using Rietveld refinement, it was found that the obtained fcc phase has crystallite size smaller than 10 nm and microstrain larger than 10−3. Both conditions are required to form an fcc phase in Ti-based alloys. For all samples, the microstructure of the fcc phase consists of equiaxial crystallites with sizes smaller than 10 nm. The largest presence of fcc phase in the studied Ti alloy was found with 6 at.\% Sn, because this alloy exhibits the largest microstrain (1.5×10−2) and crystallite size of 6.5 nm. Experimental data reveal that a solid solution and an amorphous phase were formed during milling. The necessary conditions to promote the formation of solid solution and amorphous phases were determined using thermodynamic calculations. When the amount of Sn increases, the energy required to form an amorphous phase varies from approximately 10 to approximately −5 kJ/mol for 3 and 12 at.\% Sn, respectively. The thermodynamic calculations are in agreement with XRD patterns analysis and HRTEM results.},

Different temperature-dependent strengthening mechanisms were determined. Mechanical twinning, Dynamic Strain Aging (DSA), and slip bands were the predominant mechanisms, with a combination of them depending on the stacking fault energy (SFE). The SFE decreases with the chromium content and increases with temperature, influencing the percentage of mechanical twinning generated during plastic deformation and consequently, affecting the strain hardening rate (SHR). There exists a direct relationship between strain hardening rate with temperature of deformation and mechanical twinning. DSA was observed and its effect on strain hardening was analyzed in detail.},
