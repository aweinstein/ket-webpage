#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learn#ing. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends #driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected# deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; i#dentify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep #learning to your own applications.

#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships bet#ween functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage co#mplexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an #introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day# R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. #R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web A#PIs, and building GUIs.
