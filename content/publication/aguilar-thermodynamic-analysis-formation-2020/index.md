abstract: 'A thermodynamic analysis of the synthesis of face-centred cubic (fcc) and
  body-centred cubic (bcc) solid solutions of Ti-based alloys produced by mechanical
  alloying was performed. Four Ti-based alloys were analysed: (i) Ti-13Ta-3Sn (at.%),
  (ii) Ti-30Nb-13Ta (at.%), (iii) Ti-20Nb-30Ta (wt. %) and (iv) Ti-33Nb-4Mn (at.%).
  The milled powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction, and the crystallite
  size and microstrain were determined using the Rietveld and Williamson&ndash;Hall
  methods. The Gibbs free energy of mixing for the formation of a solid solution of
  the three ternary systems (Ti-Ta-Sn, Ti-Nb-Ta and Ti-Nb-Mn) was calculated using
  an extended Miedema&rsquo;s model, applying the Materials Analysis Applying Thermodynamics
  (MAAT) software. The values of the activity of each component were determined by
  MAAT. It was found that increasing the density of crystalline defects, such as dislocations
  and crystallite boundaries, changed the solubility limit in these ternary systems.
  Therefore, at longer milling times, the Gibbs free energy increases, so there is
  a driving force to form solid solutions from elemental powders. Finally, there is
  agreement between experimental and thermodynamic data confirming the formation of
  solid solutions.'
