abstract: Froth plays an important role in flotation processes preventing the pulp
  transport to the concentrate (short-circuit). Thus, it contributes to increasing
  the concentrate grade by gravity drainage of entrained particles, back into the
  pulp. Key parameters affecting the froth performance are the mean residence times
  of solids, liquid and gas in the froth. The froth mean residence time depends on
  the froth depth, gas flowrate, gas hold-up, and flow regime. In this work, the froth
  mean residence times were evaluated from direct measurements of liquid and solid
  time responses in the froth of self-aerated copper flotation cells of 130m3. For
  this purpose the radioactive tracer technique was applied, using 82Br as liquid
  tracer, and non-floatable mineral particles in three size classes (+150; −150+45;−45μm)
  as solid tracers. All tracers were injected at the cell feed entrance, which allowed
  the tracer to circulate first through the rotor, and become well distributed over
  the whole cross-sectional area before entering the froth. Each tracer time response
  was measured on-line below the pulp/froth interface (input signal) and at the concentrate
  overflow discharge (output signal). The froth mean residence time was then obtained
  by difference between the average times of the froth input and output tracer signals,
  previously modelled. For the copper rougher flotation, the froth mean residence
  time (9–12s) of non-floatable solids, derived from experimental measurement, was
  comparable with that obtained by measuring the gas flowrate and estimating the effective
  gas volume in the froth. While, the froth mean residence times of liquid and floatable
  solid were significantly larger, 21 and 24s, respectively.
