abstract: This paper presents a coupled phenomenological model of heat transfer and
  plastic flow around the pin in friction stir welding (FSW). The approach is analogous
  to the boundary layer analysis in fluid mechanics, and is based on the methodology
  of scaling. The results are a set of novel closed-form expressions for the maximum
  temperature reached in the process, the thickness of the shear layer, the shear
  stress around the pin, the torque and the thermal effect of the shoulder. The model
  presented focuses on the most common conditions encountered in the practice of FSW,
  which involve relatively slow translation velocities, relatively high rotation velocities
  and thin shear layers. The ultimate purpose of this model is to provide simple and
  accurate expressions useful for providing a temperature and strain rate context
  for metallurgical analysis of FSW and for the selection of process parameters when
  using FSW to join novel alloys.
