abstract: The collection zone residence time distribution (RTD) of mechanical self-aerated
  flotation cells was characterized for liquid and solid per size class (−45 µm, +45–150
  µm and +150 µm). It was found that a single large industrial cell with a volume
  of 130 to 250 m3, now used in plant operations, can be well represented by an LTST
  (large and small tank-in-series) model plus dead time. From a scale-up point of
  view, results showed a similar mixing behavior for industrial cells ranging from
  130 to 250 m3. Also, single mechanical cells showed a similar mixing pattern (RTD)
  when compared to large pneumatic flotation columns. It was confirmed that for practical
  purposes, the mixing condition in a flotation bank of three or more cells in series
  can be well described by the classical N tanks-in-series model.
