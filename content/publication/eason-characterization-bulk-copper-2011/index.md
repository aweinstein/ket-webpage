abstract: The use of cold gas dynamic spray processing (cold spray), a process known
  for a coating and repair process for many alloy systems, has been demonstrated for
  the production of bulk copper deposits exceeding 25mm in thickness. The microstructure
  and hardness of the specimens were characterized in as sprayed and annealed conditions.
  Microhardness was measured in both directions from the spray/substrate interface
  to assess the effects of cold spray impact on the substrate material and to characterize
  the properties of bulk “as-sprayed” copper before and after annealing. Microstructure
  was analyzed via scanning and transmission electron microscopy.
