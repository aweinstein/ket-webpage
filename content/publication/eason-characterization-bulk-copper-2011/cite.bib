 abstract = {The use of cold gas dynamic spray processing (cold spray), a process known for a coating and repair process for many alloy systems, has been demonstrated for the production of bulk copper deposits exceeding 25mm in thickness. The microstructure and hardness of the specimens were characterized in as sprayed and annealed conditions. Microhardness was measured in both directions from the spray/substrate interface to assess the effects of cold spray impact on the substrate material and to characterize the properties of bulk “as-sprayed” copper before and after annealing. Microstructure was analyzed via scanning and transmission electron microscopy.},
