abstract: The Ti-Pt phase diagram was revised in light of new findings in the research
  related to the fabrication of alloys for high temperature shape memory alloy (HTSMA)
  application. This study focuses on alloys in the composition range 30–40at.% Pt.
  Unfortunately, the Ti-Pt phase diagram is poorly understood in this composition
  range making the development of HTSMAs difficult. Consequently, alloys in this range
  were cast, heat treated, and characterized using differential thermal analysis (DTA),
  scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) and
  transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It will be shown that the peritectoid (Ti3Pt+β
  −TiPt →Ti4Pt3) proposed by Biggs and coworkers exists, but because of sluggish transformation
  kinetic, the high temperature DTA peaks are due to the transformation of β-TiPt
  to Ti4Pt3 and vice-versa; this sometimes produces a lamellar morphology when the
  alloys are cooled slowly from temperatures above 1240°C. In addition, the alloys
  frequently contained more than two phases even after equilibration treatments. One
  of these phases is a new phase of approximate composition Ti5Pt3, which is believed
  to be stabilized by oxygen.
