 abstract = {The development of titanium foams with a low elastic modulus has increased their scientific and technological relevance due to the evident need to avoid stress shielding problems. In this work, we studied the synthesis and characterization of Ti-13Zr-13Ta-3Nb (wt.%) alloy foams which present high potential for biomedical applications. A Ti-Nb-Ta-Zr mixture was produced by mechanical alloying using a planetary mill. Ti alloy foams were obtained using NaCl as a space-holder (40, 50, and 60 v/v %) that was mixed with the metallic powders and compacted under 420 MPa stress. NaCl particles were removed from the green compacts by submerging samples in distilled water at 60 °C. The green compacts were sintered at 1300 °C for 3 h in Ar atmosphere. Powders and foams were characterized by SEM and optical microscopy. The results showed that Ti-based foams with a tailored heterogeneous pore distribution can be obtained using the space holder method. The elastic modulus (E) of foams was estimated and measured between 5 and 25 GPa using theoretical and finite element analysis (FEA) models which are close to the E values measured experimentally. The results showed that foams with 50% and 60% porosity are potential bone replacement materials because their E value is closer to the E value of human bone.},
